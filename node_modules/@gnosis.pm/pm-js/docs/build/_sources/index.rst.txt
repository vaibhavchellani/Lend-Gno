Gnosis JavaScript Library Documentation
=======================================

In order to follow these docs, you will need to be comfortable working in your OS's shell, writing JavaScript, and working with `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/>`_. A working knowledge of `Ethereum <https://www.ethereum.org/>`_, `Solidity <https://github.com/ethereum/solidity>`_, and `Truffle <http://truffleframework.com/>`_ would greatly ease the use of this library, but is not strictly necessary for getting started. The usage of a VCS such as `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is also encouraged, but is not explained here.

The Gnosis JavaScript library should work for any OS. It has the following system requirements:

* `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ (versions >= 7 should work)
* NPM (should be installed with Node.js, and versions >= 5 should work)
* `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ (optional)
